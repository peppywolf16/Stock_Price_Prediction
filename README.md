# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

## Overview

This project aims to predict stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model. By leveraging historical stock data, the project provides insights and forecasts that can enhance investment strategies.

## Objective

- Develop a predictive model for stock prices using the LSTM algorithm.

## Approach

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Utilized libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and yfinance to collect and preprocess historical stock data.
   - Handled missing values and normalized the data for better model performance.

2. **Model Design and Training:**
   - Designed an LSTM neural network to learn from past stock prices.
   - Trained the model using the processed data to predict future stock prices.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Applied Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing the predicted and actual stock prices.
   - Generated plots to compare predictions with real data and forecast future trends.

## Results

- Achieved accurate stock price predictions with a low Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- Successfully visualized trends and future forecasts, demonstrating the model's effectiveness.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required libraries: Pandas, Numpy, yfinance, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
